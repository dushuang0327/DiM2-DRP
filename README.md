<img width="6803" height="3402" alt="模型框架图" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8568cfd7-b2bf-4e8f-9529-f23e9b13c43e" />

Highlights：
• A dual-input framework integrates cancer cell states and drug structures for response prediction.

• Multi-view representations capture pathway activity, mutations, and molecular geometry.

• Bi-directional attention models explicit interactions between drugs and cancer cells.

• Dynamic contrastive learning improves generalization to unseen drugs and cell lines.

• Pathway-level signals link drug sensitivity in cell lines to patient survival outcomes.
