DiM2-DRP: Dual-Input Multi-View Dynamic Contrastive Learning Framework for Drug Response Prediction
Accurately modeling cellular states is essential for reliable drug response prediction in cancer cell lines, forming a foundational step toward robust pharmacogenomic analysis. However, existing deep learning approaches often struggle to integrate the heterogeneous and multi-scale determinants of drug sensitivity, relying on shallow representations that fail to capture interactions between cellular mechanisms and chemical perturbations. These limitations necessitate a multi-view architecture that synergistically leverages multiple biological modalities to explicitly capture drug–cell interactions. Here, we propose DiM2-DRP, a dual-input multi-view framework that integrates heterogeneous and complementary views from cancer cells and small-molecule compounds. The framework consists of a network-informed cell encoder, a structure-informed drug encoder, a bi-directional attention based contrastive fusion module, and an auxiliary classification module, enabling effective characterization of drug–cell interactions for drug response prediction. Experiments show that DiM2-DRP achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved drug-blind and cell-blind generalization, and enhanced biological interpretability compared with existing methods. The pathway signatures recovered by the model remain consistent in patient tumours and are associated with multiple clinical outcomes, supporting the translational relevance of the learned representations. By leveraging a multimodal architecture integrated with dynamic contrastive learning, DiM2-DRP refines the characterization of drug sensitivity, offering a robust framework to support precision oncology strategies.
